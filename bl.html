The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" >Network</a> is not new. In simple terms it means an interconnected set of
some objects. For decades we are familiar with the <a href="http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Default.aspx">Radio</a>, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm">Television</a>, <a href="https://www.americanrailways.com/">railway</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway">Highway</a>,
Bank and other types of networks. In recent years, the network that is making significant
impact in our day-to-day life is the Computer network. By computer network we mean
an interconnected set of <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/11063/autonomous-system-as">autonomous computers</a>. The term autonomous implies that the
computers can function independent of others. However, these computers can exchange
information with each other through the communication network system. 

<a href="index.html">Internet</a> is a collection of networks or network of networks. Various networks such as
LAN and WAN connected through suitable <a href="http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-computer-hardware-components-definition-examples.html">hardware</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> to work in a seamless
manner. It allows various applications such as <a href="https://mail.google.com">e-mail</a>, file transfer, remote log-in, World Wide Web, Multimedia,
etc run across the internet. The basic difference between <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383">WAN</a> and Internet is that WAN
is owned by a single organization while internet is not so. But with the time the line
between WAN and Internet is shrinking, and these terms are sometimes used
interchangeably. 

In a short period of time computer networks have become an indispensable part of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business">business</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry">industry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment">entertainment</a> as well as a common-man's life. These applications
have changed tremendously from time and the motivation for building these networks are
all essentially economic and technological.
Initially, computer network was developed for defense purpose, to have a secure
communication network that can even withstand a <a href="">nuclear attack</a>. After a decade or so,
companies, in various fields, started using computer networks for keeping track of
<a href="index.html">inventories</a>, <a href="images/profile.jpg">monitor productivity</a>, <a href="images/avatar.jpg">communication</a> between their different branch offices
located at different locations. For example, Railways started using computer networks by
connecting their nationwide reservation counters to provide the facility of reservation and
enquiry from any where across the country. 

Financial services: Today's financial services are totally depended on computer
networks. Application includes credit history searches, <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp">foreign exchange</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment">investment</a>
services, and electronic fund transfer, which allow user to transfer money without going
into a bank (an <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp">automated teller machine</a> is an example of electronic fund transfer,
automatic pay-check is another).
<a href="images/favicon.ico">Manufacturing</a>: Computer networks are used in many aspects of manufacturing
including manufacturing process itself. Two of them that use network to provide essential
services are <a href="https://www.autodesk.in/solutions/cad-software">computer-aided design (CAD)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing">computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM)</a>,
both of which allow multiple users to work on a project simultaneously.
